This is the AlanPoint UI, the JS lib for the [Alan Point](http://alanpoint.com "Alan Point") company. 
As you can easily see from the commit logs, it is outdated and is not supported anymore (I haven't pushed any code about two or more years for now).
The reason of why it goes public is that Alan Point is merely dead for now, and do not need any JS lib for now. 

There was a bunch of websites and webapplication, which has been written with this library, but, for now, almost all of them are dead. 

I barely can remember all of them, but it looks like only one of them are alive: [Cherinfo](http://cherinfo.com/ "Cherinfo").

I uploaded this library on github for sentimental reasons - as a creator of this megabytes of code, I just can not call <code>rm -rf ~/projects/javascript/alanpoint</code>, so it is better for all of us that this peace of software finds its rest place here. 

R.I.P.

P.S. BTW, feel free to use it in every way you want to. Also, feel free to contact me if you have any questions.

P.P.S. If you want to run it: clone it, run <code>specs/index.html</code>. Browse src folder, and do whatever you want with it. If you'll ask, I will provide more detailed info about inter-library dependencies and build tools ([apache ant](http://ant.apache.org/ "Apache Ant") based) for it.
