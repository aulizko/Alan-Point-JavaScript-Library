1) component may be separator, button, and input. We can specify its dom event listeners (like 'click', 'mousemove' and so on)
2) there are three main component holders: panel and two his descendants: toolbar and tabPanel. (actually, I plan many more others component, but let's be quiete now)
3) each component register on the root component or house on some container (like panel or so)
4) each component can throw event which will bubble up till the main root component;
5) when GUI receive "doLayout" message, it build all layout as it passed in.
